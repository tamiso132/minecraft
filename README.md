# Vulkan Extensions I should look into

## VK_EXT_shader_object
short summary, skips pipelines and no need for pipelines, which mean it is much more dynamically,__
 cause otherwise you need to specificy combinations of shaders in the pipeline, which requires all desired combination of shaders.__
 Might make modding better ?__

##  VK_KHR_timeline_semaphore

## VK_KHR_synchronization2

## Multi-Draw Indirect
Look into (this is for optimization)
